# ForensicArtifactSite
This is a work in progress, but aims to consolidate many forensic artifacts by OS in one single place. The writeups for each artifact are pulled from various sources and are rewritten or cited as needed. 

I leveraged Bootstrap to create the site.

How to: 
1. copy the repo locally making sure not to change the locations of the current file structure
2. open index.html in your favorite browser
